# all_hw_of_course_matam_2021
-Each exercise is in a different branch:

hw0:
Writing my first program in C—a program that reads a list of numbers from the input, prints out the numbers that are exact powers of 2, and also prints the sum of their exponents.

hw1:
First part—Implementing a generic Abstract Data Type (ADT) for a sorted dictionary. Each dictionary is defined with a single internal iterator that allows the user to iterate through all its elements.
Second part—Developing a chess game management system. The main structure, ChessSystem, encapsulates the data related to the games and tournaments.

hw2:
First part—Implementation of an exam management system for the students' website.
Second part—Implementation of a generic data structure called SortedList in C++ using templates, exceptions, and iterators.
Third part—Implementing actions for a game board. We enabled players to add characters to the board, move characters, and attack other characters using their own characters.
